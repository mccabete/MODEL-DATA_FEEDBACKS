# MODEL-DATA_FEEDBACKS
This repo is associated with the data and statistical analyses of the paper PUTTING MODEL-DATA FEEDBACKS INTO PRACTICE: A WORKFLOW FOR ITERATIVELY CONSTRAINING PROCESS-BASED MODELS. 

The files are organized by cogongrass traits.

 - Aboveground and belowground data amd plotting scripts for Cogongrass
 
Cogongrass Trait Measurement Summer 2019 Methods.docx
 - A detailed description of methods used for data collection. 
 
Cogongrass_PDA
 - Scripts for conducting statistical constraint, and generating figures in the paper. 
 
Config_files
 - LI-COR 6400 configuration files from light and humidity curves

 - Scripts to estimate quantum efficientcy and Vmax from light curves. 
 
humidity_curves
- Raw LI-COR 6400 files from humidity curves.

Light_curves
- Raw LI-COR 6400 files from light curves, scripts to estimate stomatal slope from light and humitidy curves. 

root_respiration_2019
- Raw LI-COR 6400 data for soil respiration, notebooks calculating respiration rate, and scripts for enter data into the BETY database. 


Files in this repo are a curated subset of files there were originally a part of a larger project. For a full history of the data or scripts, see https://github.com/mccabete/SERDP_Project.git.
